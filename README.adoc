# Rancher Node Driver for Oxide

This is a driver implementation of https://github.com/rancher/machine for Oxide.

## Build

```shell
make build
```

## Deployment

The built binary needs to be hosted somewhere that the rancher management cluster can download it.

oxide-driver.yaml:
```yaml
apiVersion: management.cattle.io/v3
kind: NodeDriver
metadata:
  name: oxide
  annotations:
    privateCredentialFields: token
    publicCredentialFields: host,project
  finalizers:
    - controller.cattle.io/node-driver-controller
spec:
  active: true
  addCloudCredential: true
  builtin: false
  checksum: "<sha256 checksum of the binary>"
  description: ""
  displayName: oxide
  externalId: ""
  uiUrl: ""
  url: https://somewhere/rancher/is/able/to/download/docker-machine-driver-oxide
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f oxide-driver.yaml
```

## UI

The default UI was sufficient for initial testing.

This was not used in the initial implementation but can be fleshed out at a later point.
